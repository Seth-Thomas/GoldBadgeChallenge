# GoldBadgeChallenge
The title of this project is "Gold Badge Console Application Challenge".  In this the challenge I created three different functional programs. The first program called "Challenge 1" allows the manager of a cafe to create, update, delete and view menu items for the cafe menu. The second program called "Challenge 2" allows an insurance claims agent to add, delete, update, and view different properties of a functioning insurance claims queue. The thrid program called "Challenge 3" utilizes a dictionary. The user of this program is ablet to add, edit, and view a list of badges that have access  to doors. The user is also able to assing certain badges with certain doors.

In order to view and run these programs you will need Visual Studio 2019. Load the project solution, set desired challenge as start up project, and hit the "start" button. You should then been able to run the program as the user with success.
